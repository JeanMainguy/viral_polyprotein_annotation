Identification of conflict between domain annotations and cleavage site annotations:
Parameters:
Maximum overlapping distance (in aa or in percentage of the domain length) which is consider as accepatble:
acceptable_overlap_threshold = 15aa or 10.0% of the domain length
A domain annotation need to be found overlapping in 50.0% of cases to be ignored by the program

The distance of overlapping corresponds to the smallest distance of the domain on the right or on the left of the cleavage site 
====================================================================================================
54 different domain annotations have been found 1634 times in the 92 analysed sequences
   Domain annotations that do not overlap cleavage sites: 49
   Domain annotations overlapping but ignored because they overlap in more than 50.0% of the cases: 5
   Domain annotations in conflict with cleavage sites; 0
   Sequence annotation in conflict with domain annotation: 0
