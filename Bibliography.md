Highlights
•  A prediction method of coronaviral 3CLpro cleavage sites was proposed to balance the accuracy and false positives.
•  Three of the nine putative non-canonical cleavage sites were verified, which are located upstream to nsp4.
•  All 11 canonical cleavage sites of MERS-CoV 3CLpro were confirmed and the Michaelis constants were calculated.
